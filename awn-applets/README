All applets for awn go here.

For a new applet, please create an directory here, with its own build system.

The hello-world applet is an *example* applet, please do not modify it. You can
use this as a basis to create your own applet, as it includes the autotools-foo
that is needed to link to libawn, plus a simple .desktop file and applet.c which
you can edit to your tastes!

awn-core-applets are those that will ship alongside Awn, these will have to 
comply with release schedules etc. When your applet becomes stable, it may be 
moved into awn-core-applets, so default awn ships with lots and lots of cool 
applets :-).

Please try and be considerate of other contributors, and try and commit from 
within your applet folder.
