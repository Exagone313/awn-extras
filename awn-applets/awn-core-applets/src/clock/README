This a clock applet from Avant-window-navigator.

Overview
========

To displays are possible:
 - digital : only digit and letter. It can show the time and the date. The format are configurable.
 - analogic : the time are display with cairo-clock themes. The date can also be displayed and the format is configurable too.
	
	

Installation
============

Use the autogen.sh && make && sudo make install
You have to install cairo-clock package to install the themes.
If it's impossible (due to the system, or other things), the path is hard coded in clock-applet.c on line 150

For the moment, the theme name is in the source code too, so if you want to change it, it's on the line 151.
Themes supported are all the cairo-clock themes.
