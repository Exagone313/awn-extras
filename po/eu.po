" Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n"
" of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t    Preamble\n"
"\n"
"  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to "
"share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is "
"intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to "
"make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public "
"License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to "
"any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free "
"Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public "
"License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.\n"
"\n"
"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  "
"Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the "
"freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service "
"if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, "
"that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; "
"and that you know you can do these things.\n"
"\n"
"  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to "
"deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These "
"restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute "
"copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n"
"\n"
"  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or "
"for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You "
"must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you "
"must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n"
"\n"
"  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) "
"offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute "
"and/or modify the software.\n"
"\n"
"  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that "
"everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If "
"the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its "
"recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any "
"problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' "
"reputations.\n"
"\n"
"  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  "
"We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will "
"individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program "
"proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be "
"licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n"
"\n"
"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and "
"modification follow.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n"
"   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
"\n"
"  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a "
"notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the "
"terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any "
"such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the "
"Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work "
"containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with "
"modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, "
"translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  "
"Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
"\n"
"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered "
"by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program "
"is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its "
"contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been "
"made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the "
"Program does.\n"
"\n"
"  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source "
"code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and "
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and "
"disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this "
"License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of "
"the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n"
"\n"
"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you "
"may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
"\n"
"  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, "
"thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such "
"modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you "
"also meet all of these conditions:\n"
"\n"
"    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n"
"    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
"\n"
"    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n"
"    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n"
"    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n"
"    parties under the terms of this License.\n"
"\n"
"    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n"
"    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n"
"    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n"
"    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n"
"    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n"
"    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n"
"    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n"
"    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n"
"    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n"
"    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n"
"\n"
"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable "
"sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be "
"reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then "
"this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you "
"distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same "
"sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the "
"distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose "
"permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each "
"and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your "
"rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise "
"the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works "
"based on the Program.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with "
"the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage "
"or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this "
"License.\n"
"\n"
"  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under "
"Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 "
"and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
"\n"
"    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n"
"    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n"
"    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; "
"or,\n"
"\n"
"    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n"
"    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n"
"    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n"
"    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n"
"    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n"
"    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n"
"\n"
"    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n"
"    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n"
"    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n"
"    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n"
"    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n"
"\n"
"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making "
"modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all "
"the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface "
"definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and "
"installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source "
"code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in "
"either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, "
"and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that "
"component itself accompanies the executable.\n"
"\n"
"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to "
"copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the "
"source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, "
"even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with "
"the object code.\n"
"\n"
"  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except "
"as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, "
"modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically "
"terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received "
"copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses "
"terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n"
"\n"
"  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed "
"it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the "
"Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you "
"do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the "
"Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of "
"this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, "
"distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n"
"\n"
"  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the "
"Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original "
"licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms "
"and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the "
"recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible "
"for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n"
"\n"
"  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent "
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), "
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or "
"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not "
"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so "
"as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any "
"other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute "
"the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies "
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both "
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the "
"Program.\n"
"\n"
"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any "
"particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and "
"the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents "
"or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; "
"this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free "
"software distribution system, which is implemented by public license "
"practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range "
"of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent "
"application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or "
"she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a "
"licensee cannot impose that choice.\n"
"\n"
"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a "
"consequence of the rest of this License.\n"
"\n"
"  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain "
"countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original "
"copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an "
"explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so "
"that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. "
" In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the "
"body of this License.\n"
"\n"
"  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of "
"the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be "
"similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to "
"address new problems or concerns.\n"
"\n"
"Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program "
"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any "
"later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions "
"either of that version or of any later version published by the Free "
"Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of "
"this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software "
"Foundation.\n"
"\n"
"  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free "
"programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to "
"ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software "
"Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make "
"exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of "
"preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of "
"promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n"
"\n"
"  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY "
"FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN "
"OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES "
"PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED "
"OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF "
"MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO "
"THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM "
"PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR "
"CORRECTION.\n"
"\n"
"  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING "
"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR "
"REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, "
"INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING "
"OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO "
"LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR "
"THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER "
"PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE "
"POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

"and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the "
"recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible "
"for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n"
"\n"
"  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent "
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), "
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or "
"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not "
"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so "
"as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any "
"other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute "
"the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies "
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both "
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the "
"Program.\n"
"\n"
"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any "
"particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and "
"the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents "
"or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; "
"this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free "
"software distribution system, which is implemented by public license "
"practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range "
"of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent "
"application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or "
"she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a "
"licensee cannot impose that choice.\n"
"\n"
"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a "
"consequence of the rest of this License.\n"
"\n"
"  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain "
"countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original "
"copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an "
"explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so "
"that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. "
" In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the "
"body of this License.\n"
"\n"
"  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of "
"the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be "
"similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to "
"address new problems or concerns.\n"
"\n"
"Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program "
"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any "
"later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions "
"either of that version or of any later version published by the Free "
"Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of "
"this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software "
"Foundation.\n"
"\n"
"  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free "
"programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to "
"ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software "
"Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make "
"exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of "
"preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of "
"promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n"
"\n"
"  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY "
"FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN "
"OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES "
"PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED "
"OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF "
"MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO "
"THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM "
"PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR "
"CORRECTION.\n"
"\n"
"  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING "
"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR "
"REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, "
"INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING "
"OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO "
"LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR "
"THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER "
